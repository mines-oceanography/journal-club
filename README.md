# ðŸŒŠ Ocean Surface Waves Journal Club

Welcome to the Ocean Surface Waves Journal Club! This guide will help you get the most out of our discussions by outlining how to prepare and participate effectively. Our goal is to explore research on ocean surface waves, share insights, and learn from each other.

### Goal:
The Journal Club is your chance to dig into ocean surface wave research, ask questions, and think critically about whatâ€™s happening in this field. The focus isn't just on what the article says but also on what makes a good paper, how the authors got their results, how reliable the data is, and what we can take away from it.

By the end of each session, you should:

- Identify any issues with the methods used in the research.
- Reflect on wheter the results presented in the paper are robust and reproducible
- Be able to discuss whether the conclusions are supported by data.
- Understand how the research connects to the bigger picture (air-sea interactions in general, climate change, ocean/lake dynamics, etc.).

###  Discussion Outline (for the discussion lead):
1. Brief Summary: Start by summarizing the article â€” what is the topic, why does it matter, and what did the authors want to figure out?
2. Methods: Describe the main methods and datasets used. What tools or models did the authors use?
3. Findings: What were the key results? Were they surprising, or do they fit with what we already know?
4. Strengths & Weaknesses: Discuss what worked well in the study and what couldâ€™ve been better. Pay particular attention to how results are displayed (are figures clear?)
5. Conclusions: Do you think the data backs up the authorsâ€™ claims? Why or why not?
6. Discussion Questions: What new questions do you have? Are these results relevant to anything else? Did it make you think of any potential follow-up studies?

### How to Prepare (everyone):
- Read the article: Pay close attention to the methods and results.
- Think critically: How do the findings fit with other things youâ€™ve read or learned about surface waves?
- **Everyone** is expected to bring at least one question and be ready to discuss any parts you didnâ€™t fully understand or want to explore further.
